 Food Delivery System

                                                                         ABSTRACT

The endeavor to develop an online food ordering system aims to replace the manual method of taking orders with a computerized one. We are planning to implement a food delivery application which will connect the Restaurants to Customers and Delivery Drivers. Where any user can create their profile and browse through all the restaurants and their menus, and they can order the through our application. Then the restaurant will be notified about the order, and they also can assign a delivery driver to the order as well.

The Food Delivery Applicationâ€™s main purpose is to keep track of information such as Restaurant details, Menu Category, Food, Delivery Address, Order, and Shopping Cart. Since it uses multiple validations and error alerts while the data is being entered, the online food ordering system is incredibly user friendly and much simpler to use for any user.
