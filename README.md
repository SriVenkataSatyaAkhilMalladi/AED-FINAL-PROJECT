Goal:
The document’s goal is to describe the Food Delivery Application’s implementation and give an overview of the project.

Project Overview:

The project we have designed is a food delivered system. This application can be used by sysadmin, Customers(users), Restaurants and delivery drivers as well. The customer can use the application to view their info, restaurants, menu and to place orders, also they can register them into the application. Restaurants can crud their menu, info and assign delivery drivers to their orders. And delivery drivers can see the orders that are assigned to them and can change their status once delivered. System admin can crud customer, restaurants and delivery driver details. 

The application has been developed on NetBeans IDE. It’s a Java Swing application. The application has been augmented with fields that are required for performing the functional requirements of the project.
MySQL database has been used to store the data so that the data is not lost after exiting the application. A robust role-based authentication module with strong username and password capabilities has been used. Exception handling is properly done to deal with any kind of exception.

                                                                ABSTRACT

The endeavor to develop an online food ordering system aims to replace the manual method of taking orders with a computerized one. We are planning to implement a food delivery application which will connect the Restaurants to Customers and Delivery Drivers. Where any user can create their profile and browse through all the restaurants and their menus, and they can order the through our application. Then the restaurant will be notified about the order, and they also can assign a delivery driver to the order as well.

The Food Delivery Application’s main purpose is to keep track of information such as Restaurant details, Menu Category, Food, Delivery Address, Order, and Shopping Cart. Since it uses multiple validations and error alerts while the data is being entered, the online food ordering system is incredibly user friendly and much simpler to use for any user.
